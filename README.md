# SBSPS-Challenge-5414-AI-Assisted-Farming-for-Crop-Recommendation-Farm-Yield-Prediction-Application

## About
Can you imagine an industry that involves more risk than agriculture? Usually, people say "You reap what you sow", but what they forget to add is "if you're lucky." When the weather strikes or cross gets affected by the disease, farmers can hardly talk about yields or when a global pandemic hits, all of a sudden it gets harder to manage various processes because most are not digital.

At the same time, the global population is growing and urbanization is continuing. Disposable income is rising, and consumption habits are changing. Farmers are under a lot of pressure to meet the increasing demand, and they need a way to increase productivity. Thirty years from now, there will be more to feed, and since the amount of fertile soil is limited, there will also be a need to move beyond traditional farming.

We need to look for ways to help farmers minimize their risks, or at least make them more manageable. Implementing artificial intelligence in agriculture on a global scale is one of the most promising opportunities.

## Solution

AI can potentially change the way we see agriculture, enabling farmers to achieve more results with less effort while bringing many other benefits like mentioned below

* With the help of AI, itâ€™s possible to automate harvesting and even predict the best time for it.

* AI can simplify crop selection and help farmers identify what sort of crop will be most profitable.

* Predictive analytics can be a real game-changer. Farmers can collect and process significantly more data and do it faster with AI than they would otherwise.        Analyzing market demand, forecasting prices, and determining the optimal time for sowing and harvesting are key challenges farmers can solve with AI.

To help farmers in minimizing the risk of agriculture we propose creating an application that recommends the farmers about the best crops to be cultivated based on climatic parameters and also predicts the yield and revenue that would be generated for cultivated land.
